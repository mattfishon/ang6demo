This project is at workspace:  

I installed nodejs into C:/tools/

When I ran:
npm install @angular/cli
I installed it locally at the project root folder...it created:
C:\project root\node_modules\@angular

Now following instrs below in section 5 only to hook angular into spring boot:
https://www.djamware.com/post/5a792ecb80aca7059c142978/spring-boot-mongodb-and-angular-5-crud-java-web-application

1) ng new frontend 
This created a huge frontend directory (i.e Application)

2) Modified outDir as specified
NOTE: With Ang 6 it seems to be angular.json file

3) cd to frontend and run  (install will install modules listed in package.json)
npm install
ng build

The above now puts stuff in src/main/resources/static/

Now used this link from beginning up to "The Resource Server" to get login working.
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/


NOTE:  After changes in frontend/app I have been in dir /frontend  using command ng build   
to regenerate files in my project static folder


Install Angular Material via this:
https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started
NOTE:  I did the install in my /frontend directory
Step 1:  I did as is
Step 2:  I skipped for now
Step 4:  Added to the styles.css
Step 5:  Skipped for now


For Material I did:
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk hammerjs
1) fixed output path
2) update styles.css

NGX-CHarts
1) npm i --save @swimlane/ngx-charts
2) npm install d3 --save
2) npm i @types/d3 --save


 
5) removed these 2 on bar and line to stop legend from showing
			  class="chart-container"
			  legend="false"
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
NOTE:  FIle not found below with verion 6 stuff.....
"styles": [
   "styles.css",
   "../node_modules/@swimlane/ngx-charts/release/ngx-charts.css"
],			  
			  
			  
TODO:  
1) /src/styles.css -   Add global ngx overrides as I can't get to work in component scss yet!
2) /src/polyfill.ts - Uncomment stuff for IE to work and fix import of classlist to abs path
2b)  fix import of classlist to use relative path directory location

Had to install this after uncommenting polyfill stuff.
npm i classlist --save 


Investigate:
1) app/browserslist for potential IE issues
